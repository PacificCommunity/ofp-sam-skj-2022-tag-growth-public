# Analysis of SKJ growth from tags and otoliths

The original analysis contains sensitive files (Japanese tagging data and SPC
database login credentials) and is therefore organized in a private repository:

* https://github.com/PacificCommunity/ofp-sam-skj-tag-growth.

This public repository is a snapshot from 15 July, after removing all sensitive
files, showcasing the analysis as open science.
